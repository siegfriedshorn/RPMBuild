The Wii build is in this repo, and you can find the netplay build here:

USE R AND Z ALTS AT YOUR OWN PERIL

Some current bugs that are on my radar:
EVA Samus needs a morph ball model

Dr. Doom Mario has issues with some of his states flashing after using fireball and fsmash.

lucasaur extends one vine sky high while tethered, and is an abomination in general. both him and cowsaur have issues with their razor leaf graphics as of right now

if you notice any more bugs please let me know so that I can fix them :) this is my first full build so I expect there to be a few on v1.0.
